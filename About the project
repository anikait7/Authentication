🔐 User Authentication Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

This is a backend project for user authentication built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It provides a secure and complete authentication flow where users can register, log in, verify their email, and reset their password using JWT tokens.

The project demonstrates a production-ready implementation of authentication, authorization, and secure user management using modern backend technologies.
